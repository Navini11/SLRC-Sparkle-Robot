# SLRC-Sparkle-Robot

## About SLRC
The Sri Lankan Robotics Challenge (SLRC) is a distinguished event hosted by the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. The competition is divided into two segments: the School Category and the University Category.

## The Team
We are a group of five enthusiastic undergraduates from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, collectively known as "We are Groot." Our team members include:

- Pulindu Vidmal
- Akhila Prabodha
- Achira Hansindu
- Navini Jagoda
- Devnith Wijesinghe

Our team secured a commendable top 15 rank in the university category and reached the finals of the competition.

## Our Task
Our project was inspired by the theme of infinity stones from the Avengers movie series. For a detailed explanation of our tasks, please refer to the attached PDF document.

## Project Challenges
Our tasks were segmented into three thematic regions, each inspired by different celestial settings:

1. **Planet A - Mountains of Vormir**
2. **Planet B - Ruins of Sakaar**
3. **Planet C - Thanosâ€™s Home**

### Task Breakdown

#### Line Following
We employed an IR array paired with a PID controller to ensure precise tracking of the line. The IR sensors detect the contrast between the white line and the black surface, allowing the PID controller to adjust the robot's trajectory dynamically.

#### Wall Color Detection
We used OpenCV with computer vision from a web camera to identify wall colors. This setup helps maintain a consistent distance from the walls while detecting required colors for navigation.

#### Color Junction Detection
We strategically placed under-mounted color sensors to detect color junctions effectively. These sensors are fine-tuned to recognize specific color configurations at junctions, guiding the robot to navigate turns accurately.

#### 3D Object Detection
We used TensorFlow and OpenCV to identify the shape of objects, determining whether an object is a cylinder or a cube. This combination of technologies provides robust shape recognition capabilities.

#### Metal Box Detection and Grabbing
We integrated conductivity testing to identify metal boxes and designed a robotic arm for precise grabbing. The conductivity sensor differentiates between metal and non-metal boxes, while the robotic arm handles the pickup and placement tasks efficiently.

#### Wall Following
A combination of front and side-mounted ultrasonic sensors was used for robust wall following. These sensors continuously monitor the distances to walls, ensuring smooth navigation without collisions.

#### Obstacle Height Detection
3 ToF sensors were utilized to measure the heights of obstacles accurately. This data helps the robot calculate the total number of gems collected based on obstacle heights.
